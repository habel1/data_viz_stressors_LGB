# Stressors in the LGB Population
## Zoe Habel
### Hello!
This repo contains the source code for the first "mini project" I created for my STAT 228: Intro to Data Science course at Simmons University. 
The aim of the mini project was to practice data visualizations using ggplot with an interesting data set. 
I've included the brief intro blurb from the blog post down below.

## Introduction

People who identify as sexual gender minorities such as lesbian, gay, or bisexual are at unique risks for several health outcomes. 
In order to further explore some of the potential vulnerabilities for certain health outcomes, I analyzed a national cohort study of LGB people. 
The survey was given in 3 waves once a year for 3 years, so there is longitudinal data on participants as well.

To look at some of the unique circumstances, I decided to look at the measures of Everyday Discrimination, 
Internalized Homophobia, Psychological Distress and Social Wellbeing as potential contributing factors to negative health outcomes. 
I was interested in seeing if certain identities are more likely to experience certain healthcare outcomes. 
Additionally, I also wanted to see how well represented different groups were across the study as a whole and at each wave.
